REQ-ID: 6
Description: The product shall be intuitive for the receptionists to use efficiently.
Type: Both Usability and Performance.
Rationale: The receptionists have complained that the existing paper-based appointments system is inefficient, which indicates they place a high degree of importance on the efficiency of the appointments system they have to use, and therefore if the system is not efficient enough, it is unlikely that they will want to continue to use it.
Fit Criterion: 90% of patients shall have their next appointment scheduled at a time and date they are happy with within two minutes of approaching the reception desk after coming out of their appointment. (Assumptions: The stakeholders recognise that certain circumstances, such as a therapist being busy or unavailable, or a difficult patient, will render it impossible to always satisfy all patients, with some leaving without making another appointment. However, in the majority of cases, for which the stakeholders have agreed a value of 90% is acceptable, scheduling of the next appointment should be reasonably quick. Two minutes was chosen as a reasonable upper bound to prevent a queue forming at reception.)
Originator: Receptionists (non-specific as stated by Neil).
Comments: [SB] Added non-functional requirement 6.
[JD] The Fit Criterion specifies one aspect of a broad requirement - booking repeat appointments. It does not quantify how the Receptionists find using the system to be more efficient in 
areas such as rearranging appointments over the phone, adding notes to patients records or running reports. Would there be a benefit in having more criteria to how one would measure an
increase of efficiency for each task carried out on the system?
