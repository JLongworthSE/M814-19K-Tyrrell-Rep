REQ-ID: 1
Description: The choice of payment methods provided by the system must be unambigous.
Type: Usability
Rationale: Staff and patients must clearly agree to the means of financial transaction used.
Fit Criterion: Over 9 in 10 stakeholder must find payment choices clear and simple.
Originator: Lily
Comments: It is important for a patient who pays for their treatment to be aware of the options available.
[SB] The fit criterion focuses on whether the stakeholders find the payment choices clear. Shouldn't it focus on the users of the system instead (receptionists and patients) and shouldn't all stakeholders agree to the proposed choice of payment methods?
