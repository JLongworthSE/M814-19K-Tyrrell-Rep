REQ-ID: 3
Description: The appointment confirmation letter should be easy to read
Type: 11
Rationale: Poorly formatted letters with small font sizes and illegible fonts will not be clearly understood by all patients (such as those with poor eyesight/visual impairment) 
Fit Criterion: The Receptionists should be able to proof-read the letter quickly, picking out the necessary details easily. Patients should be able to read the comfortably with a clear type font and size.
