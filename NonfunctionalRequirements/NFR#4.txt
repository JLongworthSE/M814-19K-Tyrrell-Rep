REQ-ID: 4
Description: Only authorised users should be able to create appointments.
Type:Non-Functional
Rationale: To avoid too many users being able to create appointments and cause confusion.  
Fit Criterion: 0 appointments will be created by an unauthorised user.
Originator: Carol, the Office Manager
Comments: [FM] Fran Moore - adding requirement 4.
[SB] I agree with this except I think the type should specifically be a security requirement. Should the fit criterion state a time period for no appointments to be created by an authorised user? (I think this is needed to make the requirement testable.)
