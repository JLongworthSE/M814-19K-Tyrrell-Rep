REQ-ID: 4
Description: Only receptionists and the office manager should be able to create appointments.
Type:Non-Functional (Security)
Rationale: To avoid too many users being able to create appointments and cause confusion.  
Fit Criterion: 0 appointments will be created by an unauthorised user indefinitely.
Originator: Carol, the Office Manager
Comments: [FM] Fran Moore - adding requirement 4.
[SB] I agree with this except I think the type should specifically be a security requirement. Should the fit criterion state a time period for no appointments to be created by an authorised user? (I think this is needed to make the requirement testable.)
[TB] Yes this is a security requirement and should be functional in terms of groups/categories of users that would have these privileges, ie. therapist group
[JG] Security and data integrity is an example of how NFRs can add functionality to a project for non-functional reasons. Who would have access in this scenario?
