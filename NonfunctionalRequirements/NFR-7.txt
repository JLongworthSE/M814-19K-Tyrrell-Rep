Comments: [dash78] adding requirement #7
[TB] Should note that correct needs to ccompare against the input data, and what required information is required.
[FM] How is it determined that the invoice is correct?
[LW] If this is a straight comparison between the input data being exported correctly, I see no reason to have any margin for error, 100% should be achievable.
